# My_First_MERN

This is the fist fullstack application what I've created with help of an online course.
It uses css and React on the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose on the backend.

You are free to watch inside the code, but it's way too much download, rewrite and use it for your own good.
If you are interested how does it look like in the end, here's the link, where I uploadied it on Heroku:

You can register and watch what is inside of it, nothing bad will happen to you, and you can easily delete your account after you finished.
